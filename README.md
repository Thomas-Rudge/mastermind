#### Starting a new Game

```ruby
require 'mastermind'

Game.new.start
```
You'll then be asked whether you want to play, and which mode you want to play in. Codemaker will require you to create a code that the program will then try to break. In codebreaker mode you will have to try and guess the code randomly generated by the program.

<small>As a short hand you can type 0 for codebreaker and 1 for codemaker.</small>

#### Playing the Game

If you are the codemaker, then just sit back and watch the program try and guess your code.

If you are the codebreaker, then you will be prompted for a guess.

The game will issue hints with each consequtive guess. A black peg denotes a correct colour in the correct place, a white peg denotes a correct colour in the wrong place.
